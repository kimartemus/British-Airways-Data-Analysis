# British-Airways-Data-Analysis
# Overview
This repository contains the analysis and predictive modeling work performed for British Airways (BA). The tasks include scraping customer reviews, analyzing the data to gain insights, and training a machine learning model to predict customer bookings. The goal is to leverage data to improve customer acquisition and enhance overall business strategies.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the scraped customer feedback data and any intermediate files used for analysis.
notebooks/: Includes Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, and analysis.
scripts/: Contains Python scripts for data scraping, cleaning, and model training.
results/: Contains visualizations and the final PowerPoint slide summarizing insights and findings.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.
Data Collection
Scraping Data
Source: Skytrax
Objective: Collect reviews specifically about British Airways.
Tools: Python (BeautifulSoup, requests)
Data Files
reviews_data.csv: The raw data collected from Skytrax, containing customer reviews of British Airways.

# Data Analysis
Preparation

Cleaning: Removed irrelevant data, handled missing values, and standardized text for analysis.
Exploration: Analyzed basic statistics and text content.

Analysis Techniques
Topic Modeling: Identified main topics in the customer reviews.
Sentiment Analysis: Assessed the sentiment of the reviews to understand customer satisfaction.
Word Clouds: Visualized common terms used in the reviews.

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, WordCloud)
Jupyter Notebook

# Predictive Modeling
Model Training
Objective: Predict customer bookings based on the provided booking data.
Algorithm: Random Forest (chosen for its ability to output feature importance)
Evaluation: Conducted cross-validation and used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Files
model.pkl: The trained machine learning model.
feature_importance.png: Visualization showing the contribution of each variable to the model's predictions.

# Presentation
A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings from the data analysis and predictive modeling is included.
results/BA_Analysis_Presentation.pptx: The final slide deck for presentation to the management team.
